# Problem 02:  Find Maximum Temperature by year

## Requirements
- python3
- hadoop
- mrjob

## Solution Implementation
```python
from mrjob.job import MRJob
class MRMaxTemp(MRJob):
	def mapper(self, _, line):
		MISSING = 9999
		good_quality = set("01459")
		year = line[15:19]
		temperature = int(line[87:92])
		quality = line[92:93]
		if quality in good_quality and abs(temperature) != MISSING:
			yield(year, temperature)
	def reducer(self, year, temperatures):
		yield(year, max(temperatures))
if __name__ == '__main__':
	MRMaxTemp.run()
```

## How to Run Solution
To run the fractions operation in python program, grab a copy of the current directory
from GitHub. After that, get the latest version of `python` and install `mrjob` using following command
```console
pip install mrjob
```
Now, all you have to do is run the following command from the command line:
```console
python MaxTemperature.py input/1901 input/1902 -r hadoop > output/max_temperature.txt
```

## Output
The output file generated by hadoop is located in output directory.

|  year  | maximum temperature |
|--------|---------------------|
| "1901" |         317         |
| "1902" |         244         |
